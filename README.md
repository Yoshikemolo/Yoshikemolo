# Hi, I'm @Yoshikemolo ðŸ‘‹

I'm a senior full-stack engineer with over 30 years of experience in the software industry. I've worked on a wide range of projects, from programming video games on the ZX Spectrum with an 8-bit CPU and 48KB of RAM in the 80s to building cutting-edge distributed systems in the cloud using AWS, Google Cloud, and the latest technologies such as machine learning and artificial intelligence.

- Creating multi-platform and responsive web applications and web elements using different frameworks like Angular and Ionic

## Experience ðŸš€
During my career, I have combined my roles as a senior engineer and manager of international software companies for up to 20 years. This has given me a broad perspective, versatility, and experience to design any software product from RFP to test, passing through technical design, UX design, development, and operations. I have worked on dozens of big projects and have experience collecting end-user requirements and designing new software products from scratch.

## Design ðŸŽ¨
I am also an expert in UX and UI design and have experience designing software products from scratch using DDD and SCRUM methodologies. I create Design Systems based on Atomic Design and create mockups in collaborative design tools such as Sketch Up, InVision, and Figma. As a passionate front-end developer, I turn those mockups into real products using libraries such as Material, Ant Design, and UI components libraries like NgZorro or Telerik and especially PrimeNG.

## Collaboration ðŸ‘€
I'm always looking for new opportunities to collaborate on projects that involve UX and front-end development. If you'd like to get in touch, you can email me at jorge.rodriguez.rengel@gmail.com.
